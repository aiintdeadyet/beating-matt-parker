Trying make better code than Matt parker made in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33AZBnRHks&t=74s

## Rules

Must be coded in such a way that Matt Parker could have coded this on his own.
This means in python, without speshal librarrys, can only use basic featurs that can be learned after a few minuts of googling. All words must be words that are acualy in the english language (We will be using a very liberal deffinition of words in the english language but if you want a more strict deffinition you can just swap the word list).
