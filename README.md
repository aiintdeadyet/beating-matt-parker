# beating-matt-parker

Trying make better code than Matt parker made in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33AZBnRHks&t=74s

## Rules
Must be coded in such a way that Matt Parker could have coded this on his own. 
This means in python, without speshal librarrys, can only use basic featurs that can be learned after a few minuts of googling.
